Udacity Project: Movie Trailer website by Sean Harte
Program: Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree


This project will generate a Movie trailer website called Heart Movie Trailers. It should display 21 movies. You can click on each movie and watch its youtube trailer. The source code from the movie trailer website is from adarsh (https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode). This project uses the API from the movie db (TMDB). I use TMDB full movie data base for my movie information. Depending on when you are trying this code my api-key might be out of date. To get your own api just go to https://www.themoviedb.org.


How to Run.
To run the movie trailer website, follow these steps.
1. Download Python 2.7.9 or higher.
2. Open and run entertainment_center.py.
3. A file index.html should load in your web browser.
